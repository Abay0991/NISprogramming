# Create a script threadedcounter.py.
# In this script you are required to manually create 2 threads.
# The one thread should start on a function called incrementor and the other should start on;
# A function called decrementor. Both the functions should receive a numeric value as an argument.
# The 2 threads should both receive the same numeric argument.
# Use logging to display how the one function increments the value and the other decrements the value.
# The main program should wait until both threads have finished their execution before ending the program.
